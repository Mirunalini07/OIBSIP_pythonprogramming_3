The objective of this project is to design and implement a simple voice assistant that:

Converts voice input into text.

Processes the command.

Performs tasks based on the command.

Provides output in both text and voice format.
This helps in learning Python libraries, automation concepts, and real-time interaction systems.




The voice assistant can:

Greet the user.

Respond to “Hello”.

Tell the current time and date.

Search information on Google.

Provide short information from Wikipedia.

Open YouTube.

Open Notepad.

Open Calculator.

Respond to basic conversations like:

“How are you?”

“What is your name?”

Exit the assistant when the user says “stop” or “exit”.

Implemented text-to-speech to provide voice responses.

Created functions to record and process audio.

Added command handling using conditional statements.

Integrated Google search and Wikipedia API.

Added system automation like opening applications.
